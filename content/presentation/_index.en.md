Why "Observatoire Sans TÃªte" ?

This name comes from a joke with my friend Bob, which consists of translating word for word "Headless Observatory".
This term gives the desired goal: an autonomous server that can be controlled remotely.

On its form, it is inspired by many other opensource projects:
- https://github.com/GuLinux/AstroPhoto-Plus
- https://github.com/pludov/mobindi
- https://www.indigo-astronomy.org/for-users.html

Of course the inspiration also comes from commercial solutions:
- ASIAIR
- Stellarmate
